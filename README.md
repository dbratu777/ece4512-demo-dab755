## Bio

My name is Daniel Bratu; I am a Computer Engineering student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the Bagely College of Engineering at Mississippi State University. From May 2023 to August 2024, I worked with [Camgian](https://www.camgian.com/), a commerical and defense oriented software solution company, as a software engineering student worker. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with various OSes to experience new or unusual workflows; I also play a lot of FPS and traditional dungeon-crawler games.
